"""Documentation contract for the PRISM v2 product.

This suite pins the public docs (README + ``docs/**``) to the ACTUAL v2 system: the two-script
submission contract (``architecture.py``/``build_model`` + ``training.py``/``train``), the locked
FineWeb-Edu data plane (read-only, no network), the forced random-init validator re-execution,
**research-lab identity** (norm = try new architectures; goal = more performant ones), the
**dual param ladder** (124M explore provisional → 350M promote confirm/revoke), emission scoring
that is **held-out / generalization primary** with prequential bits-per-byte **secondary**
(Official-like), multimetric/Complete View as **published scientific research grade** (not the
emission scalar), **deterministic admission** (LLM hard gate and gateway removed), the single-node
multi-GPU contract, two-tier **0.50/0.50** ownership, and dry-run weights. It also asserts the docs
no longer reference the decommissioned v1-NAS machinery (component-review holds, ownership events,
the retired ``prism_run_manifest.v1.json``, or the removed ``local_cpu_smoke`` execution mode).

Assertions are anchored on real code constants so the docs cannot drift from the implementation.
