# Submission Format

PRISM accepts a **two-script** bundle: a `.zip` archive (or directory snapshot) containing a model
`architecture.py` and a training `training.py`. PRISM fixes the FineWeb-Edu dataset and the evaluation
protocol, not the model search space beyond the Python contract, the AST sandbox, the 150M parameter
cap, and the resource limits.

The miner owns the model and the training loop. The challenge owns the dataset and the scoring: it
re-executes `training.py` under a forced random init and a fixed seed, records the online loss stream
itself, authors the run manifest, and ignores any value the miner reports.
A single combined module no longer satisfies the contract.
See [Architecture](architecture.md) and [Scoring](scoring.md) for the re-execution and scoring detail.
For the architecture-agnostic **Official Comparison Protocol v1** (held-out primary ranking, honest
hooks table, GPU deferred without NVIDIA) and multimetric scorecard annex **v1.1**
(`scorecard_id=multimetric.v1.1`), see [Official Comparison](official-comparison.md).
## The Two-Script Contract

A bundle must contain two **distinct** scripts.

`architecture.py` exposes a factory that returns a `torch.nn.Module`:

```python
def build_model(ctx):
    return MyModel(ctx.vocab_size)
```

It may use any PyTorch structure inside the AST sandbox, the 150M parameter cap, and the resource
limits. It must not read data, open files, touch the network, or reference the dataset.

`training.py` exposes the miner-owned training loop:

```python
def train(ctx):
    model = ctx.build_model()
    # optimizer/schedule, read the locked train split from ctx.data_dir, tokenize,
    # run the loop, handle multi-GPU, write only under ctx.artifacts_dir.
    ...
```

`train(ctx)` owns the optimizer, schedule, dataloading from the read-only locked train split,
tokenization, the multi-GPU strategy, and the loop. It reports progress only through the
challenge-provided logging handle, never as the basis of the score.

### Honest training hooks (challenge-owned score)

| Hook | Required? | Authoritative for score? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `build_model(ctx) → nn.Module` | Yes | Indirectly (must construct under forced seed / param cap) |
| `train(ctx)` consuming `ctx.iter_train_batches(...)` | Yes for honest online capture | Capture path is challenge-owned; return value ignored |
| Optional logs / free-form diagnostics under `artifacts_dir` | Optional | **No** — non-authoritative diagnostics only |
| Miner self-reported bpb / `final_score` / home-rolled manifest | Forbidden as trust root | **Never** — Prism recomputes official metrics |

Wall-clock and miner-timing claims never rank. Full Official Comparison honesty checklist:
[Official Comparison Protocol v1](official-comparison.md#7-training-script-honest-hooks-contract).

An optional `prism.yaml` declares the entrypoints and tokenizer:

```yaml
architecture:
  entrypoint: architecture.py
training:
  entrypoint: training.py
tokenizer: gpt2
```

Absent `prism.yaml`, PRISM uses the default entrypoints (`architecture.py`, `training.py`) and symbols
(`build_model`, `train`); when present, declared entrypoints are honored exactly, with no silent
fallback. The two entrypoints must be distinct files: **the single-module re-export idiom no longer
satisfies the contract**.

## PrismContext

Both scripts receive a `PrismContext`:

| Field / method | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `vocab_size`, `max_seq_len` | Token-id geometry |
| `max_params` | Hard parameter cap (150M) |
| `seed` | The forced seed (challenge-controlled; the miner cannot change it) |
| `data_dir` | Read-only path to the locked FineWeb-Edu **train** split |
| `artifacts_dir` | The only writable path (rank-0 writes) |
| `device`, `world_size`, `rank`, `local_rank` | Distributed launch geometry |
| `token_budget`, `step_budget` | Compute budget for the run |
| `build_model()` | Builds the model from `architecture.py` |
| `reference_tokenizer(name)` | Loads a pre-staged offline tokenizer (`"gpt2"` or `"llama"`); never touches the network |

The miner does **not** control the dataset content or splits, the seed/init, the scoring, or the
held-out evaluation.

## Locked FineWeb-Edu Data Plane

The dataset is a pinned FineWeb-Edu subset in fixed, disjoint parts:

- `train/` raw text shards, exposed **read-only** at `ctx.data_dir`;
- `val/` and `test/` held-out raw text, **secret** and **never exposed** to the miner script, read only
  by the challenge scorer.

Delivery is a read-only bind mount on the GPU node. The eval container runs with `network=none`,
`HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`, and `HF_DATASETS_OFFLINE=1`, so there is **no network** during training. The miner
tokenizes raw text from `ctx.data_dir` with its own or a pre-staged reference tokenizer, failing closed
if the locked data is missing rather than fabricating data.

## Multi-GPU Contract

The miner's `training.py` owns multi-GPU scaling. The harness launches
`torchrun --standalone --nnodes=1 --nproc-per-node=<gpu_count>`, exposing `WORLD_SIZE`, `RANK`, and
`LOCAL_RANK`. PRISM is **single-node** only: runs use 1-8 GPUs on one node, and the official scored run
uses `torchrun --standalone --nnodes=1 --nproc-per-node=1` (the `nproc=1` path, since one physical GPU
exists). Requests above 8 GPUs or for multiple nodes are rejected.

A correct `training.py` calls `init_process_group` (nccl on GPU) and `set_device(local_rank)`, wraps the
model with DDP or FSDP and shards data per-rank, does rank-0-only writes, all-reduces reported metrics,
tears down the process group on exit, and also works at `world_size=1`. Correctness is validated off the
single physical GPU with a static contract check and a **gloo** multi-rank test (world size 2 and 4 on
CPU) asserting the loss decreases and parameters stay byte-identical across ranks. True 8-GPU scaling is
an accepted, unverifiable limitation on a one-GPU node.

## Artifact Manifest

The runner writes a challenge-authored `prism_run_manifest.v2.json` from the captured loss stream: the
prequential bits-per-byte score block, the held-out delta and anti-memorization gap, the compute block
(leased `gpu_count`, world size, device, realized parameter count), the run provenance, and the byte
coverage. Any miner-written manifest or reported metric is discarded.

## Minimal Example

```text
project.zip
  architecture.py   # exposes build_model(ctx)
  training.py       # exposes train(ctx)
  prism.yaml        # optional
```

The container resolves `architecture.py::build_model` and `training.py::train`, forces the seed,
launches torchrun, and captures the online loss itself. Complete, runnable lab seeds:

- Transformer: [tiny ~1M-parameter example](../examples/tiny-1m/README.md) (family
  `transformer-tiny-1m`)
- Mamba / pure-torch SSM: [mamba-tiny example](../examples/mamba-tiny/README.md) (family
  `mamba-tiny-1m`; no blocked native `mamba_ssm` for the static lab path)

Package either or both with `scripts/pack_seed_family.py` (shared outer two-script zip shape). Lab
family knobs (param counting shape, batch/LR step flu, pure-torch SSM caveats, multi-GPU primitives)
are documented on each seed README and in the [miner guide](miner/README.md#lab-seed-families).

## ZIP Safety Rules

ZIP submissions are extracted defensively: no path traversal, no symlinks, limited file count, limited
total bytes, only approved text or code suffixes. Unsupported or unsafe archives are rejected before
evaluation.
