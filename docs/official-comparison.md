# Prism Official Comparison Protocol v1

**Version label:** `prism_official_compare.v1`  
**Document status:** Operator- and miner-facing protocol (docs + tests first)  
**Audience:** Operators running offline A-vs-B architecture/training comparisons; miners building unknown architectures under fair matched budgets  

This document defines **Prism Official Comparison Protocol v1**: an architecture-agnostic protocol for ranking any two qualifying training submissions (or seed packages) under matched data, tokens/bytes, seeds, and fairness constraints. It is the **scientific lab/compare surface** (published research grade via multimetric / Complete View). It is **not** a silent replacement for the live emission scalar. Production integrity is **PROVIDER_TRUST** (Lium/Targon) + **IMAGE_PIN**; **REAL-PROVIDER TEE** is retired Prism product language (historical tables may still say BLOCKED).

For production subnet scoring (leaderboard emission rank, raw-weight push), see [Scoring](scoring.md).
**Emission volume-1 is Official-like:** held-out / generalization **PRIMARY**, prequential bpb
**SECONDARY**. Official Comparison keeps the same primary/secondary order for pair ranks and **adds**
the multi-axis multimetric / Complete View scientific vector with polar honesty. Multimetric and
Complete View remain **published research grade** and do **not** silently replace emission in v1.

---

## 1. Purpose

Official Comparison answers:

> Under one pinned FineWeb-Edu revision, forced random init, challenge-owned single-pass batches, matched token/byte budgets, and multi-seed residual, which of two unknown architectures (or training recipes) generalizes better, with prequential compression as the secondary signal?

Goals:

1. Fair compare of **unknown architectures** expressible under the AST sandbox and dual param ladder (default explore **124M**; promote **350M**) — Transformer, Mamba/SSM pure-torch, looped depth, and any other `nn.Module` that meets the forward contract.
2. Prefer **held-out generalization** as the ranking primary so train-only compression or memorization does not win headlines.
3. Keep **prequential bpb** as a always-Prism-recomputed secondary signal.
4. Keep wall-clock, miner self-reports, and REAL-PROVIDER TEE labels out of the ranking key.
5. Document that real multi-step GPU pair trains are **deferred** on hosts without NVIDIA (this protocol still allows CPU/fixture unit compares).
6. Publish multimetric / Complete View as **scientific research grade** without claiming they are the emission scalar.

Non-goals in v1:

- Silently folding multimetric / Complete View axes into the emission crown (future phase only with explicit product bump).
- Replacing subnet emission two-tier ownership (architecture **0.50** / training **0.50**).
- Using lm-eval / GSM8K / MMLU as primary fair learning signals for from-scratch compare.
- Inventing Lium/Targon trust roots or labeling Lium deploy smoke as REAL-PROVIDER PASS.

## 2. Catalogue of terms

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Emission / leaderboard scoring** | Production path: **held-out/generalization primary**, prequential bpb secondary; drives emission rank / raw weights ([Scoring](scoring.md)). |
| **Official Comparison mode** | Offline/lab pair ranking under this protocol: same **held-out/generalization primary**, prequential bpb secondary, plus multi-axis scientific annexes. |
| **Multimetric / Complete View** | Published **scientific research grade** vector (`multimetric.v1.1`, `complete_view.v1.2` / `v1.3`); **not** the emission scalar in v1. |
| **Protocol pin** | Frozen JSON-ish knobs (dataset pin, tokenizer, budgets, seeds, device class). Both sides must run under the same pin hash. |
| **Unknown architecture** | Any `torch.nn.Module` built by `build_model(ctx)` under sandbox and param cap; no family-specific score path. |
| **Miner self-report** | Any number, log line, or manifest the miner writes; **never authoritative**. |
| **Challenge-owned metric** | Metrics Prism recomputes from its own capture / host held-out (`prism_run_manifest.v2.json`). |
| **PROVIDER_TRUST / IMAGE_PIN** | Production integrity: trusted Lium/Targon + pinned image digest (max tier 1). See [Security](security.md). |
| **REAL-PROVIDER TEE** (retired) | Historical honesty label only. Orthogonal to Official Comparison; **BLOCKED** / not a Prism product goal. |

---

## 3. Modes

| Mode | Frozen | Free variable | Headline use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ArchCompare** (default official headline) | Same `training.py` (hash), protocol pin, tokenizer, seeds | `architecture.py` only | Is architecture X a better learner than Y under matched train recipe? |
| **TrainCompare** | Same `architecture.py`, pin, seeds | `training.py` only | Is recipe R better on fixed architecture? |
| **SystemCompare** | Only the protocol pin | Both scripts | Closest to open miner battle; weaker scientific isolation |

Live subnet submission remains SystemCompare-shaped; Official Comparison **ArchCompare** is the recommended scientific claim.

---

## 4. Fixed fairness constraints (normative)

Every Official Comparison pair member MUST satisfy:

1. **Matched token/byte budget** — both sides bound primarily by the same `token_budget` (and optional identical `step_budget`). Prefer `stopped_reason == "token_budget"`. If either side is bound by wall-clock alone, the pair run is **invalid** for official ranking.
2. **Matched byte measure** — primary denominators remain UTF-8 **bytes** on the locked stream (tokenizer-agnostic compression measure). Protocol may additionally force a referee tokenizer so packing is comparable.
3. **Forced random init** — challenge seed family applied before miner import; `ctx.seed` immutable; bootstrap / resume checkpoints forbidden for official inject.
4. **Challenge-owned batches** — training sinks via `ctx.iter_train_batches(...)` (single-pass instrument; predict-then-train capture). Private re-loaders that bypass the instrument disqualify.
5. **Dual param ladder** — default explore `max_parameters = 124_000_000` (provisional); promote pin `350_000_000`. Realized param count rechecked after first forward on the scored model. Pin documents which stage applies.
6. **Wall-clock never primary** — wall-clock is a safety watchdog only. It never enters the ranking key and must not silently become the effective sample-size limit for a fair pair.
7. **Secret val/test** — never mounted into the train container; host-only held-out.
8. **Miner self-report never authoritative** — miner-written manifests, self-reported bpb, wall-time claims, and free-form diagnostics cannot certify official rank.
9. **Matched multi-seed residual** — official claims use the same seed list K≥3 for both sides (default seeds documented below). Rank residual uses multi-seed aggregate, not a cherry-picked seed.
10. **Sandbox purity** — pure Python/torch surface; no network, no custom blocked CUDA plugin imports.
11. **Scored path nproc** — default official pin uses `scored_nproc = 1` for both; multi-GPU only if both sides run under the same world size pin.

---

## 5. Ranking axes (Official Comparison mode)

### 5.1 PRIMARY: held-out / generalization

Primary ranking prefers **held-out generalization** quality.

Documented primary forms (use one consistently per pin; higher is better for delta form, lower is better for absolute val bpb form):

| Form | Direction | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`heldout_delta`** (preferred) | **higher better** | `bpb(random-init twin on val) − bpb(trained on val)` on the secret val prefix |
| **`val_bpb_trained`** (alternate pin option) | **lower better** | Absolute held-out free energy when twin delta is unavailable |

“Honestly lower held-out free energy” (or larger honest improvement over the random-init twin) ranks higher. A train-only memorizer must not win on primary.

When multi-seed:

\[
\text{primary}_S = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{heldout\_delta}(S; \mathrm{seed}_k)
\quad\text{(higher better)}
\]

(or the documented alternate mean of `val_bpb_trained`, lower better).

### 5.2 SECONDARY: prequential bits-per-byte

**Prequential bpb** remains the architecture-agnostic secondary signal and is **always recomputed by Prism** from challenge-owned run data:

```text
bpb = (sum_neg_log_likelihood_nats / ln(2)) / covered_bytes
```

Lower bpb is better. Multi-seed:

\[
\text{secondary}_S = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^{K} \mathrm{bpb}(S; \mathrm{seed}_k)
\]

Miner-reported train metrics **cannot** certify secondary rank. Production `final_score = 1/(1+bpb)` (before penalty/tie fold) may be reported for continuity with the leaderboard transform, but Official Comparison scientific ranking keys secondary as raw recomputed bpb first.

### 5.3 Anti-overfit gates (always active)

| Gate | Threshold / rule | Effect under Official Comparison |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Memorization gap** | `gap > 1.0` bpb (`MEMORIZATION_GAP_THRESHOLD_BPB`) using converged train vs val bpb when bases comparable | Flag + ×0.5 penalty on score surface; higher overfit rate loses tertiary rank |
| **Step-0 anomaly** | `step0_loss < 0.5 * ln(vocab)` (`STEP0_ANOMALY_FRACTION`) | Anti-cheat multiplier → 0; that seed run disqualified / final surface zeroed |
| **No-learning** | Late loss ~ baseline on worker plausibility path | Disqualify run |
| **Degenerate bpb** | non-positive / non-finite / empty coverage / insane band | Fail closed, not ranked |

These gates prevent pure train memorizers and smuggled-weight runs from winning on secondary compression looks.

### 5.4 Wall-clock

Wall-clock seconds may appear in observability `compute` blocks and lab diagnostics. **Wall-clock never ranks.** Two records with identical quality metrics and different `wall_clock_seconds` must compare equal on the official key.

### 5.5 Deterministic compare rule `compare_official(A, B)`

Given two official multi-seed aggregates (or single-seed records when residual multi-seed is not yet filled):

```text
ε_h  = 5e-3     # primary near-tie band (heldout_delta or same units as pin primary)
ε_b  = 5e-3     # secondary bpb near-tie band (reuses HELDOUT_DELTA_BPB_EPSILON scale)
K    = len(seeds)  # ≥ 1 for unit fixtures; ≥ 3 for official public claims

1) Validity: both sides pass stop_reason / finite / no step0 on included seeds.
2) PRIMARY held-out:
   if primary(A) better than primary(B) by > ε_h → A
   if primary(B) better than primary(A) by > ε_h → B
3) SECONDARY prequential bpb (lower better):
   if secondary(A) < secondary(B) − ε_b → A
   if secondary(B) < secondary(A) − ε_b → B
4) Anti-overfit residual:
   lower memorization/overfit fraction wins; if step0/disqualify asymmetric, the clean side wins
5) Multi-seed residual (when K>1 and still tied):
   lower variance / better median secondary among clean seeds; else TIE
6) Never consult wall_clock or miner self-report
```

“Better” for primary:

- if pin uses `heldout_delta`: larger mean is better  
- if pin uses `val_bpb_trained`: smaller mean is better  

Implementation helps land as a pure deterministic helper (fixture-tested) in the scoring track; this document is the normative order those helpers must implement.

### 5.6 Emission vs scientific surfaces (aligned primary, distinct products)

| Axis | Production emission ([scoring.md](scoring.md)) | Official Comparison Protocol v1 (this document) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rank key 1 | **Held-out generalization** | **Held-out generalization** |
| Rank key 2 | **Prequential bpb** (Prism-recomputed) | **Prequential bpb** (Prism-recomputed) |
| Multi-axis vector | Not required inside emission scalar v1 | multimetric.v1.1 / Complete View scientific grade |
| Anti-overfit / step-0 | Active | Active (unchanged semantics) |
| Wall-clock | Not scored | Not ranked |
| Emission weights | Derived from emission leaderboard path | Multimetric / Complete View **do not** silently drive emission |

Emission volume-1 is Official-like on primary/secondary axes. Multimetric and Complete View remain
**published research grade** and must not be documented as the silent emission crown.

---

## 6. Protocol pin (`ProtocolPin`)

Official pairs share one pin object. Operators SHOULD record a content hash of the pin into the compare report provenance.

```yaml
protocol_id: prism_official_compare.v1
data:
  dataset: HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu
  pin_sha: "87f09149ef4734204d70ed1d046ddc9ca3f2b8f9"  # must match product dataset.py
  split: train
  partition: as locked MANIFEST.json buckets
tokenizer: gpt2                 # forced offline reference for ArchCompare packing hygiene
vocab_size: 50304
seq_len: 128                    # lab default; raise on GPU hosts when budgets allow
batch_size: 4
token_budget: 500000            # must bind both sides before wall_clock
step_budget: null
wall_clock_seconds: 1200        # safety only; fair-pair invalid if stop_reason is wall_clock alone
seeds: [1337, 2027, 4242]       # K=3 minimum for public official claims
param_cap: 124000000            # explore default; promote pin may use 350000000
ladder_stage: explore           # explore (124M provisional) | promote (350M confirm/revoke)
scored_nproc: 1
device: cuda                    # or cpu for fixture / short CPU seeds
force_iter_train_batches: true
require_trained_state: true
heldout:
  val_byte_budget: 65536
  gap_threshold_bpb: 1.0
primary_form: heldout_delta     # or val_bpb_trained
```

**Hard validity for each pair member:**

1. Manifest is challenge-authored; `miner_reported_ignored: true`.
2. `stopped_reason` is `token_budget` (preferred) or both sides data-exhausted at equal covered_bytes under the same pin.
3. Finite positive bpb in-band; no step-0 anomaly on included seeds.
4. Realized `model_params ≤ param_cap` for the pin stage (124M explore default; 350M promote).
5. Seed list applied identically (matched residual).
6. Held-out present for official master/host path; worker `skip_heldout` outputs are not official compare witnesses alone.

**Default exploration shapes under 124M** (shared zip packaging):

- Transformer: `examples/tiny-1m` (`transformer-tiny-1m`)
- Mamba pure-torch: `examples/mamba-tiny` (`mamba-tiny-1m`)

Package via `scripts/pack_seed_family.py` / `prism_challenge.seed_packaging`.

## 7. Training-script honest hooks contract

Official Comparison reuses the two-script product contract ([Submissions](submissions.md)). The honest recovery surface:

### 7.1 Required hooks

| Hook | Script | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `build_model(ctx) -> nn.Module` | `architecture.py` | Pure factory. No data reads, no network, no files. Param count ≤ pin cap (124M explore / 350M promote) under forced seed. Logits contract: `forward(tokens) → logits[B,T,V]` (or `.logits` / first tuple). |
| `train(ctx) -> None` | `training.py` | Owns optimizer, schedule, multi-GPU, loop. Builds via `build_model` / `ctx.build_model()`. **Consumes challenge batches only** through `ctx.iter_train_batches(...)`. Return values are ignored for score. |

### 7.2 Challenge fields miners must honor

| Field / method | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `ctx.seed` | Forced, immutable honest init seed |
| `ctx.data_dir` | Read-only train split path |
| `ctx.artifacts_dir` | Sole writable root (rank 0) |
| `ctx.token_budget` / `ctx.step_budget` | Binding single-pass caps for fair pin |
| `ctx.iter_train_batches(model, batch_size=, seq_len=, tokenizer=)` | **Required** instrument for honest leak capture |
| `ctx.build_model()` | Force-seeded factory invocation |
| `ctx.reference_tokenizer("gpt2" \| "llama")` | Offline staged; no network |
| Optional `artifacts_dir/trained_state.pt` | Host held-out needs state when pin requires it |

### 7.3 Optional non-authoritative diagnostics

Miners MAY log progress strings, publish extra tensors under `artifacts_dir`, or attach free-form diagnostics for human debugging.

Those diagnostics are:

- allowed to be **recorded**,
- **never** used as the official rank key,
- superseded by Prism recomputation of bpb, held-out, memorization flags, and step-0.

### 7.4 Forbidden trust roots

| Forbidden | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Miner self-reported `final_score` / bpb as authority | Score is challenge-owned only |
| Miner-written `prism_run_manifest*.json` | Challenge authors `prism_run_manifest.v2.json` |
| Pretrained weight smuggle / resume capable of surviving forced init claims | Step-0 anomaly + forced seed |
| Private loaders that skip `iter_train_batches` under official pin | Breaks single-pass capture honesty |
| Ranking by wall-clock or GPU count | Explicitly out of ranking key |
| Claiming REAL-PROVIDER TEE PASS from compare docs | TEE decision is orthogonal; real provider still blocked |

Sketch (honest `train`):

```python
def train(ctx):
    model = ctx.build_model().to(ctx.device)
    opt = ...  # miner-owned
    tok = ctx.reference_tokenizer("gpt2")  # protocol pin tokenizer for ArchCompare
    for batch in ctx.iter_train_batches(
        model, batch_size=4, seq_len=128, tokenizer=tok
    ):
        logits = model(batch.tokens)
        loss = next_token_ce(logits, batch.tokens)
        loss.backward()
        opt.step()
    if ctx.rank == 0 and ctx.artifacts_dir:
        torch.save(model.state_dict(), f"{ctx.artifacts_dir}/trained_state.pt")
```

---

## 8. GPU verification deferred (host without NVIDIA)

Official Comparison **does not require** a GPU host for protocol docs, unit fixtures, or CPU/synthetic dual-family compare harnesses.

### 8.1 Environment fact (this mission host, 2026-07-14)

| Probe | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `nvidia-smi` | Not found |
| `/dev/nvidia*` | Absent |
| Docker runtimes | `runc` / `runsc` — **no nvidia runtime** |
| GPU device requesting containers | Cannot select device driver with GPU capabilities |

Therefore:

- **Real multi-step GPU official smoke is DEFERRED** on this host and any host with the same absence.
- Workers MUST NOT claim GPU verification PASS, “NVIDIA validated,” or REAL-PROVIDER GPU TEE PASS from this environment.
- CPU unit fixtures, synthetic score records, and short seed packaging tests remain valid Protocol surfaces (`device: cpu` pin or fixture manifests).

### 8.2 When GPU becomes available

On a host with working NVIDIA + Docker GPU runtime:

1. Run both sides under the same ProtocolPin with `device: cuda` and `token_budget` large enough that both stop on `token_budget`, not wall-clock.
2. Capture challenge-authored manifests per seed, pin hash, and `compare_official` outcome.
3. Still label provider integrity honestly: PROVIDER_TRUST / IMAGE_PIN / LAB-GPU; REAL-PROVIDER TEE remains a retired historical BLOCKED label only, independently of the scientific ranking.

### 8.3 LAB-GPU path without local NVIDIA (remote CUDA + host rank)

Local `nvidia-smi` DEFERRED applies to **host-local GPU smoke** only. When real dual-family CUDA trains already ran on a remote GPU (e.g. paid Lium long train under a matched Protocol pin) and challenge-owned `prism_run_manifest.v2.json` artifacts were brought back:

1. Rank on a **CPU mission host** with `python -m prism_challenge.evaluator.official_compare_harness --lab-gpu-artifacts <root>`.
2. Label the report `score_class=LAB-GPU` / `device_class=lab-gpu` (not fixture-only synthetic; not “DEFERRED-for-no-nvidia”).
3. Primary = held-out; secondary = Prism-recomputed prequential bpb; wall-clock recorded but ignored for rank.
4. `REAL-PROVIDER TEE` remains **BLOCKED / NOT_CLAIMED** (retired product language). Lab score success never implements REAL-PROVIDER TEE PASS and invents no trust roots. Use PROVIDER_TRUST / LAB-GPU / IMAGE_PIN labels.

Short vs long refers to the remote train pin (token budget / spend ceiling), not the host rank step. Missing dual-family manifests must surface as **BLOCKED**, not invented scores. See [Operators — Lab GPU short/long Official Comparison](operators.md#lab-gpu-shortlong-official-comparison-host-rank-of-remote-cuda).

---

## 9. Provider trust honesty is orthogonal (REAL-PROVIDER TEE retired)

Official Comparison ranking compares **learning quality metrics** only.

| Classification | Relation to official rank |
| --- | --- |
| No TEE / provider-trust path | Default production path; may produce lab metric records; does not improve rank by itself |
| PROVIDER_TRUST + IMAGE_PIN | Production integrity levers (Lium/Targon + pinned digest tier-1); orthogonal to pair rank |
| Lium / Targon deploy smoke | Infra `DEPLOY SMOKE PASS|FAIL` only |
| `REAL-PROVIDER TEE PASS` (retired) | **BLOCKED** historical honesty only; **not** a Prism product goal; **not** unlocked by Official Comparison |

Protocol docs and compare reports MUST keep a clean separation paragraph: scoring comparison never claims REAL-PROVIDER TEE PASS. Prism has **no** TEE production scoring gate; score finalize never fails closed on missing TEE evidence.

---

## 10. Report sketch (`prism_compare_report.v1`)

Offline harnesses SHOULD emit a stable report (JSON) shaped like:

```json
{
  "schema": "prism_compare_report.v1",
  "protocol_id": "prism_official_compare.v1",
  "protocol_hash": "...",
  "mode": "ArchCompare",
  "primary_form": "heldout_delta",
  "side_a": {"label": "transformer-tiny-1m", "bundle_hash": "..."},
  "side_b": {"label": "mamba-tiny-1m", "bundle_hash": "..."},
  "seeds": [1337, 2027, 4242],
  "aggregate": {
    "a": {
      "mean_heldout_delta": 0.0,
      "mean_bpb": 0.0,
      "std_bpb": 0.0,
      "overfit_rate": 0.0
    },
    "b": {}
  },
  "ranking": {
    "winner": "a|b|tie",
    "rule": "heldout_primary_then_bpb_secondary",
    "eps_heldout": 0.005,
    "eps_bpb": 0.005
  },
  "validity": {"ok": true, "reasons": []},
  "tee_note": "orthogonal; REAL-PROVIDER PASS not claimed"
}
```

Unit fixtures may fill synthetic metrics without multi-hour train. Live emission weights are out of this report.

---

## 11. Operator checklist

1. Choose mode (ArchCompare recommended).
2. Freeze ProtocolPin; write pin hash into evidence.
3. Package both sides under two-script zip contract and dual-ladder/sandbox gates (124M explore default).
4. Run matched seeds; require challenge-authored manifests.
5. Verify validity (token_budget stop, no step0, held-out present for official claims).
6. Aggregate multi-seed primary held-out and secondary bpb.
7. Apply `compare_official` order; ignore wall-clock and miner diagnostics.
8. Document GPU deferred if no NVIDIA; document TEE class without overclaim.
9. Do not push compare winners into emission narrative as if they were automatic weight crowns unless production scoring independently agrees.

### 11.1 Offline dual-family CPU/fixture harness (no NVIDIA)

Product harness: `python -m prism_challenge.evaluator.official_compare_harness`.

It packages the registered unknown-style dual families (`transformer-tiny-1m` + `mamba-tiny-1m`), builds multi-seed official records from challenge-owned synthetic metrics (or operator-supplied fixture metrics), and emits `prism_compare_report.v1.json` with a clear `ranking.winner` A vs B under this protocol. See [Operator Guide — Offline Official Comparison](operators.md#offline-official-comparison-cpu--fixture) for copy-paste commands.

```bash
export UV_CACHE_DIR=/var/tmp/uv-cache
uv run python -m prism_challenge.evaluator.official_compare_harness \
  --output-dir dist/official-compare --device-class fixture
uv run pytest tests/test_official_compare_harness.py -q
```

GPU verification status in the **fixture** report is **DEFERRED** when the host lacks NVIDIA; that harness never toggles `claim_gpu_pass` to true.

### 11.2 LAB-GPU host rank of remote train artifacts

```bash
export UV_CACHE_DIR=/var/tmp/uv-cache
uv run python -m prism_challenge.evaluator.official_compare_harness \
  --lab-gpu-artifacts /path/to/artifacts/out \
  --output-dir dist/official-compare-lab-gpu \
  --seed 1337
uv run pytest tests/test_official_compare_harness.py -q -k lab_gpu
```

Report marks `score_class=LAB-GPU`, `gpu_verification.status=LAB-GPU`, `real_provider_tee=BLOCKED`. Exit `2` is a clear BLOCKED when artifacts are missing.

### 11.3 Scale-eval product pin + Complete View densify entrypoints

Scale ladder P0+ product surface: `prism_challenge.evaluator.scale_eval`.

| Helper | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `scale_p0_protocol_pin()` | Explore pin with public **K≥3** seeds `(1337, 2027, 4242)`, seq=128, token_budget=500k; raises if public K required and seeds short |
| `scale_pin_fields` / `scale_pin_public_ok` / `assert_public_multi_seed_pin` | Document + guard multi-seed pin eligibility |
| `densify_entrypoints()` | Machine map of long_ctx / sample_eff densify APIs |
| `densify_complete_view_pair(a, b, panel=...)` | One entrypoint → Complete View with long_ctx and/or sample_eff panels (host densify; does **not** rewrite emission) |
| `run_scale_multi_family_host_compare(...)` | Multi-family host compare under the P0 pin (fixture or LAB-GPU artifacts; missing → `BLOCKED_with_reason`) |
| `tee_package_absent()` | Confirms Prism `tee` package remains deleted |

Direct densify modules (prefer host on existing weights before new trains):

* long_ctx: `complete_view_longctx.build_complete_view_with_longctx_quality`
* sample_eff: `complete_view_eff.build_complete_view_with_eff_stability`
* multi-family: `multi_family_compare.run_multi_family_lab_gpu_host_compare`

Rank regression freeze: `tests/test_scale_rank_regression.py` (heldout-primary + anti mem/step0/self-report + K≥3 pin + tee absent).

```bash
export UV_CACHE_DIR=/var/tmp/uv-cache PRISM_DOCKER_BACKEND=cli
uv run pytest tests/test_scale_rank_regression.py -q
uv run python -c "from prism_challenge.evaluator.scale_eval import densify_entrypoints, scale_p0_protocol_pin; print(scale_p0_protocol_pin().seeds); print(densify_entrypoints()['long_ctx']['build_view'])"
```

## 12. Relation to other docs

| Doc | Relationship |
| --- | --- |
| [Scoring](scoring.md) | Production emission math (held-out primary + bpb secondary); multimetric not emission scalar |
| [Submissions](submissions.md) | Two-script contract and `PrismContext` honest hooks |
| [Operators](operators.md) | Offline dual-family Official Comparison harness (CPU/fixture) + LAB-GPU host rank of remote CUDA |
| [Miner guide](miner/README.md) | Lab seed families and submission shape |
| [Security](security.md) | Sandbox, deterministic admission, provider trust + IMAGE_PIN honesty |
| [Scaling](scaling.md) | Single-node multi-GPU contract (pin may force nproc=1) |

Research background (mission-only audit, not shipping product claim): assembly notes that predated this lock may still talk “bpb primary” for scientific MDL framing of the **capture metric**. Under **user-locked Official Comparison v1 ranking**, held-out/generalization is PRIMARY and bpb is SECONDARY.

---

## 13. Versioning

- **v1** = base protocol in this document: held-out primary, bpb secondary, anti-overfit + step-0, matched budgets, wall-clock never primary, multi-seed residual, honest hooks, miner self-report non-authoritative, TEE orthogonal, GPU deferred without NVIDIA / LAB-GPU remote rank allowed.
- **v1.1 scorecard annex** = additive multi-metric scorecard (`scorecard_id=multimetric.v1.1`) defined in §14. It **does not** replace v1 `compare_official` default rank when axes do not polar-conflict. A full sole weighted-crown rewrite remains reserved for a future `v2+` protocol_id and is **not** claimed by v1.1.
- Breaking changes to pin fields, ranking order, or honesty rules of the base protocol require a new protocol_id (`v2+`) and a docs bump. Additive scorecard fields may evolve under the `scorecard_id` namespace without rewriting base `protocol_id`.

---

## 14. Multi-metric scorecard annex v1.1 (`scorecard_id=multimetric.v1.1`)

**Annex identity:** Official Comparison multi-metric scorecard **v1.1**  
**scorecard_id:** `multimetric.v1.1`  
**Base protocol:** still `prism_official_compare.v1`  
**Status:** Additive annex on Protocol v1 (not a full v2 sole weighted crown rewrite)  
**Design baseline:** mission research `official-comparison-multimetric-v2-design.md` adapted here as the shipping v1.1 annex vocabulary (tiers V/P/S/R, metric catalogue, polar rule, floors, non-claims). Product code lands scorecard fields and suites in the accompanying `comp-scorecard` track.

### 14.1 Why v1 alone is not architecture superiority

Protocol v1 + a single short-context dual-family CUDA train can publish a valid `primary_heldout` winner under a matched pin. That is **not** enough to claim architecture superiority of Mamba over Transformer (or the reverse):

| Gap | Why it breaks a superiority claim |
| --- | --- |
| K=1 seed | Init / stream luck; public non-provisional claims require multi-seed K≥3 |
| Short `seq_len` only | Known SSM associative-recall / lag weaknesses untested; Transformer long-T cost unmeasured |
| No long-ctx suite | Needle, MQAR, induction/copy, lag-NLL not in the rank key |
| No sample-efficiency curve | End-of-budget snapshot confounds slow-start vs asymptote |
| No efficiency annex | Peak VRAM / tokens-per-s / params unreported as Pareto surface |
| Recipe confounds | Different train LRs or recipes can look like “arch” wins |
| Secondary may disagree primary | A single scalar crown hides axis conflict |

Scorecard v1.1 exists so partial scoreboards stop over-claiming while still preserving the v1 default rank when axes agree.

### 14.2 Relationship to Protocol v1 default rank

| Situation | Authoritative headline winner |
| --- | --- |
| Scientific axes do **not** polar-conflict (short-gen clear winner; long-ctx does not reverse beyond ε, or long-ctx suite disabled / not yet filled) | **v1 preserved:** `compare_official` held-out primary then prequential bpb secondary (`reason=primary_heldout` or documented bpb secondary) |
| Short-gen winner and long-ctx winner disagree beyond ε, or one side fails a long-ctx floor while the other passes | **`TIE_POLAR`** (see §14.5); `crown_allowed=false`; scorecard vector must be published |
| K_clean < 3 | Public posture is **provisional** only (no architecture-superiority language) |

Default ranking order for the `ranking.winner` field therefore remains Protocol v1 when polar conflict is absent. The scorecard annex always extends the report with a multi-metric vector; it does not silently replace emission or invent a sole weighted crown.

### 14.3 Tiers V / P / S / R

| Tier | Name | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **V** | Validity gates | Fail-closed before scientific ranking. Both sides must pass included-seed gates. |
| **P** | Primary scientific axes | Co-equal scorecard axes that must appear in published vectors when the suite is enabled. |
| **S** | Secondary / efficiency | Continuity with v1 secondary bpb plus Pareto efficiency (VRAM, tok/s, params). Efficiency never sole-ranks over scientific axes under a polar rule. |
| **R** | Robustness residual | Multi-seed variance, memo/step0 residual, stability flags. |
| **D** | Diagnostic only (optional) | Estimated FLOPs, UI scalar mash — never authoritative for arch supremacy. |

### 14.4 Full A→Z metric catalogue

Direction: **↑** higher better, **↓** lower better. Floors and ε bands are host/pin-documented; random baselines are recorded per task when accuracies are published.

#### Validity (V)

| ID | Metric | Definition | Dir |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M-V01 | `stop_token_budget` | Both sides stop on `token_budget` (or equal data_exhausted + equal covered_bytes) | bool |
| M-V02 | `finite_bpb` | Prism-recomputed bpb finite, in-band, positive coverage | bool |
| M-V03 | `step0_clean` | Step-0 anomaly absent (`step0_loss ≥ 0.5 · ln(V)`) | bool |
| M-V04 | `param_cap` | Realized params ≤ pin stage cap (124M explore / 350M promote; rechecked after first scored forward) | bool |
| M-V05 | `matched_pin` | Protocol pin hash equality both sides | bool |
| M-V06 | `multi_seed_K` | Public non-provisional requires clean K≥3; K=1 is provisional only | bool/label |
| M-V07 | `challenge_authored` | Miner self-report ignored; challenge owns metrics | bool |
| M-V08 | `force_instrument` | Training sinks via `iter_train_batches` / honest hooks | bool |

#### Primary scientific (P) — short-gen, long-ctx, sample-eff, memo

| ID | Metric | Definition | Dir |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M-P01 | short-gen `heldout_delta` | Mean `bpb(random twin) − bpb(trained)` on secret val (preferred primary A) | ↑ |
| M-P02 | short-gen `val_bpb_trained` | Absolute held-out free energy when twin unavailable | ↓ |
| M-P03 | long-ctx suite mean | Macro-mean of normalized task scores at eval T ≥ train T: **needle**, **MQAR** / associative recall, **induction** / copy | ↑ |
| M-P04 | `lag_nll` | Held-text next-token NLL/bpb stratified by lag bins (long-lag bucket reported) | ↓ |
| M-P05 | sample-efficiency | Quality-vs-tokens curve: multi-mark online stream bpb or AUC from challenge capture marks (e.g. 50k/100k/250k/500k) | ↑ quality / ↓ bpb@marks |
| M-P06 | memorization `memo_gap` | Converged train vs val bpb gap; threshold 1.0 remains; continuous + flag | ↓ gap |

**Long-context suite notes (seed-scale defaults):**

| Task | Probe intent | Floor note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Needle** | Selective retrieval under distractors at depth ∈ {0.1, 0.5, 0.9}·T | Publish accuracy and relative_to_chance vs random baseline; lab floor is pin-documented (e.g. relative_to_chance ≥ 0.05 when suite enabled) |
| **MQAR / associative recall** | Key–value binding under many pairs / lag | Same relative-to-chance honesty; chance baseline recorded |
| **Induction / copy** | In-context bigram completion / exact copy after delimiter | Exact-match or restricted-candidate accuracy; near-zero open-vocab chance for free copy |
| **lag-NLL** | Compression quality vs dependency distance | Long-lag bin must not be silently omitted when suite enabled |

When long-ctx suite is **disabled**, reports MUST mark long-ctx fields as not-run / null rather than inventing metrics. Implementation of suite runners is a product code track; this annex freezes the catalogue and floors vocabulary.

#### Secondary / efficiency (S)

| ID | Metric | Definition | Dir |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M-S01 | prequential `bpb` | Prism online CE code-length / covered_bytes (v1 secondary continuity) | ↓ |
| M-S02 | `params` | Realized parameter count | ↓ among iso-quality |
| M-S03 | peak `VRAM` | Peak allocator GiB during train and/or long eval when GPU available | ↓ |
| M-S04 | `tokens_per_s` | Tokens processed / wall during train (diagnostic Pareto; pure-torch SSM thrash allowed) | ↑ |
| M-S05 | quality-per-param / quality-per-GiB | Optional display ratios within matched size band | ↑ |

Efficiency fields never alone overturn a scientific axis under the polar rule. Wall-clock alone still never ranks.

#### Robustness / stability (R)

| ID | Metric | Definition | Dir |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M-R01 | `seed_std_bpb` | Std of secondary bpb across clean seeds (when K>1) | ↓ |
| M-R02 | `seed_std_heldout` | Std of heldout_delta across clean seeds | ↓ |
| M-R03 | stability | NaN/Inf events, grad-spike rate, instability flag from train capture | ↓ / clean preferred |
| M-R04 | memo / step0 residual | Memorization flag rate and step0 disqualify residual on scorecard | clean preferred |

### 14.5 Polar conflict rule (`TIE_POLAR`)

Normative when the long-ctx suite is enabled and measurably filled:

```text
ε_h = 5e-3   # short-gen (heldout_delta or pin primary units)
ε_l = 0.02   # long_ctx mean accuracy (or pin-documented long-ctx units)

if short-gen(A) better than short-gen(B) by > ε_h
   AND long_ctx(B) better than long_ctx(A) by > ε_l:
       authoritative claim = TIE_POLAR
       crown_allowed = false
       publish full scorecard vector for A and B
       forbid solitary architecture supremacy language

# Floor form (equivalent protective effect):
if A fails long_ctx floor and B passes → B may take long-ctx competence; if short-gen still favors A beyond ε_h, still TIE_POLAR (no sole crown)
if both fail long_ctx floor → no arch-supremacy language; diagnostics only beyond V/S residual
```

When long-ctx is disabled or both long-ctx scores are null/not-run, polar comparison does not fire and **v1 primary_heldout default rank is preserved**.

`crown_allowed=false` means: report `ranking.winner` may surface `tie` / `TIE_POLAR` (or a provisional field) and consumers **must not** announce a unique architecture crown. Downstream UI may still show the vector for operators.

### 14.6 Multi-seed public vs provisional

| Seed posture | Label | Allowed language |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clean K≥3 under matched pin | public scorecard (when other V gates pass) | Rank + scorecard under v1.1 rules |
| K=1 or K_clean < 3 | **provisional** | Lab signal only; no architecture superiority claim |
| Invalid V on both | invalid / unranked pair | Blocked or non-claim |

### 14.7 Honesty: prior LAB-GPU K=1 short-ctx mamba heldout lead is provisional only

A prior LAB-GPU dual-family short-context run under Protocol pin v1 (example: `seq_len=128`, `token_budget=500000`, **seed list K=1**, pure-torch Transformer vs Mamba seeds) observed a **mamba-tiny-1m higher `heldout_delta`** than `transformer-tiny-1m`, with Transformer stronger on secondary prequential bpb. Host rank therefore used `reason=primary_heldout` with `score_class=LAB-GPU`.

Under scorecard v1.1 that prior win is:

- **valid as a provisional short-ctx, K=1, token-budget-matched lab observation**
- **insufficient for architecture superiority** of Mamba over Transformers
- **not** a multi-seed public claim
- **not** a long-context, sample-efficiency, or efficiency claim
- **not** a REAL-PROVIDER TEE claim
- **not** an automatic emission weight crown

Full architecture claim language requires the multi-metric scorecard (this annex) with multi-seed K≥3 public posture and meets scientific axes without forbidden polar crown.

### 14.8 Non-claims (normative)

Scorecard v1.1 **does not**:

1. Claim **REAL-PROVIDER TEE PASS** (remote CUDA / Lium rent / LAB-GPU scores never unlock REAL-PROVIDER).
2. Rewrite production emission crown alone without the multimetric scientific vector (emission stays held-out primary + bpb secondary on [Scoring](scoring.md); multimetric remains research grade).
3. Define a secret sole weighted scalar that replaces the published vector as the only scientific output.
4. Invent long-ctx / efficiency metrics when suites did not run (fail closed: mark BLOCKED / not-run).
5. Treat wall-clock or miner self-report as rank authority.
6. Promote today’s or any K=1 short-ctx win as literature-grade architecture superiority.

Optional dual scalar indexes for UI (if ever published) MUST be labeled non-authoritative and still subject to V floors + `TIE_POLAR`.

### 14.9 Report annex sketch

Reports MAY extend `prism_compare_report.v1` (or emit a parallel annex block) with:

```json
{
  "schema": "prism_compare_report.v1",
  "protocol_id": "prism_official_compare.v1",
  "scorecard_id": "multimetric.v1.1",
  "scorecard": {
    "tiers": ["V", "P", "S", "R"],
    "multi_seed": {"K": 1, "public": false, "provisional": true},
    "validity": {"stop_token_budget": true, "finite_bpb": true, "step0_clean": true, "param_cap": true, "matched_pin": true},
    "short_gen": {"heldout_delta_a": null, "heldout_delta_b": null},
    "long_ctx": {
      "enabled": false,
      "needle": null,
      "mqar": null,
      "induction_copy": null,
      "lag_nll": null,
      "suite_mean": null,
      "floors_relative_to_chance": true
    },
    "sample_efficiency": null,
    "memorization": {"memo_gap_a": null, "memo_gap_b": null},
    "efficiency": {"peak_vram_gib": null, "tokens_per_s": null, "params": null},
    "stability": {"nan_inf_events": null, "grad_spike_rate": null},
    "polar": {
      "tie_polar": false,
      "crown_allowed": true,
      "reason": null
    }
  },
  "ranking": {
    "winner": "a|b|tie",
    "rule": "heldout_primary_then_bpb_secondary",
    "default_v1_preserved_when_no_polar_conflict": true
  },
  "tee_note": "orthogonal; REAL-PROVIDER PASS not claimed",
  "honesty_note": "prior LAB-GPU K=1 short-ctx mamba heldout lead is provisional only; scorecard required for full claim language"
}
```

When polar conflict fires, set `polar.tie_polar=true`, `polar.crown_allowed=false`, and make the authoritative claim `TIE_POLAR` regardless of pure short-gen inclination.

### 14.10 Operator readiness (scorecard suites)

1. Run Protocol v1 validity + short-gen first (CPU fixture or LAB-GPU manifests).
2. Fill multi-seed K≥3 for public posture when claiming beyond provisional.
3. Run long-ctx suite (needle / MQAR / induction-copy / lag-NLL) and record floors vs chance.
4. Derive sample-efficiency marks from challenge online capture (not miner curves).
5. Record efficiency (VRAM / tok/s / params) when GPU path available.
6. Emit scorecard vector + apply `TIE_POLAR` if short-gen vs long-ctx disagree.
7. Keep REAL-PROVIDER TEE = **BLOCKED**; always-terminate paid pods; no Swarm mutate; no `set_weights` from compare.

See [Operators](operators.md) for offline harness and LAB-GPU host-rank commands; suite runners land with the implementation track.

## 15. Complete View v1.2 (MAX A→Z machine JSON)

Complete View expands multimetric.v1.1 into a **maximum A→Z architecture comparison** dashboard while remaining protocol-honest.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Machine schema | **`complete_view.v1.2`** |
| Scorecard identity | **`scorecard_id=multimetric.complete.v1.2`** |
| Dashboard id | `scorecard_complete_view.v1.2` |
| Protocol pin | still **`prism_official_compare.v1`** |
| Historical annex | **`multimetric.v1.1`** remains valid (not rewritten / not emission-authoritative) |
| Alias (consistent only) | `prism_complete_compare.v1.2` may appear as compare_id_alias |

### 15.1 Ranking / multi-axis honesty

- Output is a **multi-axis comparison object**: per-axis leads + disagreement matrix + metric vector.
- **No opaque weighted sole crown.** There is no secret scalar that replaces the panel vector as the only scientific output.
- Expand **TIE_POLAR** honesty across scientific axes (short-gen, long-ctx, sample-eff, length-extrap, …). When scientific axes conflict beyond ε, `tie_polar=true` and **`crown_allowed=false`**.
- Efficiency / wall-clock / FLOPs remain diagnostic (never sole-rank; never override polar).
- Default multimetric.v1.1 heldout-primary path remains when no scientific polar conflict fires.

### 15.2 Metric matrix (must-have + nice-to-have)

Must-have catalogue (from Complete A→Z gap research): absolute multi-seed `val_bpb_trained`, multi-T long-ctx suite, needle-by-depth + lost-in-middle, MQAR N×lag grid, unfused induction vs exact-copy, lag-NLL bins, length-extrapolation CE, denser sample-efficiency, train vs eval@T efficiency + state footprint, grad/nan stability, multi-order residual, derived quality_per_param / quality_per_gib, floor honesty. Nice-to-have (calibration/entropy, AR gen proxy, multi-budget scaling, …) must be present as values **or** explicit null + reason (no silent omission).

Machine panel keys:

`P0_rank_overlay`, `P1_short_gen`, `P2_sample_efficiency`, `P3_long_ctx`, `P4_length_extrap`, `P5_efficiency`, `P6_memory_state`, `P7_stability_robustness`, `P8_calibration_entropy_optional`, `P9_validity`.

```

Preferred outside-repo evidence filename: `complete_view.v1.2.json`. Product module: `prism_challenge.evaluator.complete_view`.

### 15.4 Non-claims (Complete View)

1. **REAL-PROVIDER TEE PASS** remains **BLOCKED** (LAB-GPU / suite fill never unlocks REAL).
2. Not the production emission weight crown (emission stays held-out primary + bpb secondary; multimetric/Complete View are research grade).
3. Not an opaque weighted sole arch crown.
4. Historical multimetric.v1.1 annex is not erased; Complete View expands visibility only.
5. Missing suites: null + reason, never invented non-null metrics.

Operator pointer only — full suite runners and remesure belong to Complete View implementation features; ops entry: [Operators](operators.md) Complete View section.

## 16. Complete View v1.3 (reasoning / logic panel P10)

Complete View v1.3 expands v1.2 with a dedicated **reasoning and logic** panel while preserving the complete.v1.2 history and the multimetric.v1.1 annex.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Machine schema | **`complete_view.v1.3`** |
| Scorecard identity | **`scorecard_id=multimetric.complete.v1.3`** |
| Dashboard id | `scorecard_complete_view.v1.3` |
| Protocol pin | still **`prism_official_compare.v1`** |
| Historical Complete View | **`multimetric.complete.v1.2`** / `complete_view.v1.2` **preserved** (not rewritten) |
| Historical scorecard annex | **`multimetric.v1.1`** remains valid further up the chain |
| New panel | **`P10_reasoning_logic`** |
| Alias | `prism_complete_compare.v1.3` |

### 16.1 Why synthetic challenge-owned probes only

These scores are for **~7M from-scratch single-pass** lab seeds (realized counts under gpt2 vocab; example labels may say tiny-1m). They are **LAB / diagnostic architecture comparison only**.

**Explicit non-claims (VAL-REASON-001 / VAL-REASON-012):**

1. Seed-scale synthetic logic probes **do not certify human-level reasoning**, AGI, IQ, or curriculum-trained benchmark SOTA.
2. **NOT GSM8K / MMLU / lm-eval** as primary fair signals for these ArchCompare seeds (external knowledge + instruction formats the pin never taught).
3. Not the production **emission weight crown** (emission stays held-out primary + bpb secondary; this panel is research grade).
4. **REAL-PROVIDER TEE PASS** remains **BLOCKED** (orthogonal; suite fill never unlocks REAL).
5. Efficiency / wall-clock never sole-rank; no opaque weighted sole crown.
6. Near-chance on both-sides outcomes are **valid science** at seed scale, not a product failure.

### 16.2 Probe catalogue (must-have, challenge-owned)

Must-have synthetic probes (suite_id `logic_synthetic.v1`):

| Probe key | Cognitive target | Default chance |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `boolean_parity_xor` | Boolean / parity / XOR chains | 0.5 |
| `arith_digit_mod` | Digit / mod arithmetic toys | 0.1 |
| `transitive_compare` | Transitive multi-hop comparison | 0.25 |
| `multihop_binding` | Role/composition multi-hop (**distinct from P3 MQAR**) | 0.125 |
| `sort_order` | Sort / order / sequencing | 0.25 |
| `reverse_edit` | Reverse / simple string edits (≠ exact copy) | 0.25 |
| `count_stream` | Counting over streams | 0.1 |
| `dyck_nesting` | Bounded Dyck / nesting | 0.5 |
| `instruction_toy` | Instruction-toy format templates | 0.2 |
| `contradiction_detect` | Consistency / contradiction detect | 0.5 |

Plus aggregate **`logic_suite_mean`** (macro mean of RL-01..10 with relative-to-chance floors; soft `REASONING_REL_FLOOR=0.05`).

Nice-to-have residuals under P10 (filled **or** explicit null+reason): `cot_free_gen_collapse`, `logic_ece`, `poly_vs_exp_length`.

### 16.3 Scoring channels

Every must-have probe declares **dual channels**:

1. **Closed-choice accuracy** (primary absolute + `relative_to_chance`)
2. **Forced CE** on the gold answer span (continuous surrogate near chance)

Chance baselines are published in the machine `chance_table`. Architecture-agnostic logits only (no attention/SSM state kits). Prefer host densify on existing K=3 `trained_state` before any retrain.

### 16.4 Multi-axis expansion (reasoning + polar honesty)

- Scientific / polar axes now include **`reasoning`** (higher = `logic_rel_macro` / suite_mean relative quality).
- When `short_gen` and `reasoning` (or other polar axes) disagree beyond ε, publish **`TIE_POLAR`** with `crown_allowed=false`.
- `P0_rank_overlay.reasoning_lead` surfaces the multi-axis lead.
- Disagreement matrix can pair reasoning vs short_gen / long_ctx.
- If both sides fail disclosed logic floors, leads may stay floor-vetoed / tie; no sole supremacy marketing language.

Preferred evidence filename: `complete_view.v1.3.json` under mission `evidence/official-comparison/complete-view-v1-3/`. Product module: `prism_challenge.evaluator.complete_view` (panel builders for filled probes land in later reason-logic features).

### 16.6 Relation to §15 Complete View v1.2

Section 15 remains the complete.v1.2 identity and A→Z residual matrix description. v1.3 **adds** P10 and the reasoning multi-axis without erasing v1.2 machine identity strings as history. Operators and remesure runners may still produce or read v1.2 JSON as historical inputs; new primary identity for reasoning expansion is **v1.3**.

## 17. Challenge-owned train series telemetry (`prism_train_series.v1`)

Official Comparison / Complete View rate **architecture packages** scientifically. Operators also need a **time-flow** view of how a package trained (loss shape, gradients, clip thrash) under the same honesty rules as capturable ceilings. That surface is challenge-owned train series telemetry.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Machine schema | **`prism_train_series.v1`** (identity-locked; product-equivalent names must keep this string) |
| Authority | **Challenge-owned only** (same trust class as online_loss / `prism_run_manifest.v2`) |
| Miner dashboards / self-logs | **Non-authoritative** — ignored for grade, residual, and Official validity |
| Scientific grade surface | Multi-axis Official Comparison / Complete View (held-out primary + bpb secondary + polar axes); **not** emission scalar |
| Emission leaderboard | Held-out primary + bpb secondary (`final_score` / emission rank path) — series never substitute emissions |
| Rank role of series | **Visibility** + densify **sample-eff / stability residual only** — **never sole primary rank** over held-out/bpb Official axes |
| Fail-closed pin | When Official / Complete View grading pin sets `require_train_series=true`, missing / empty / corrupt challenge series **fail-closes** Official grade (not silent PASS) |

### 17.1 Rating system lock (scientific vs emission)

| Surface | Primary signal | Series role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scientific miner arch grade** | Multi-axis Official Comparison / Complete View: held-out / generalization primary, prequential bpb secondary, multi-axis vector (long-ctx, reasoning, sample-eff, …), `TIE_POLAR` honesty; **published research grade, not emission scalar** | Time-flow visibility; densify sample-eff marks & stability residual (`grad_norm` / clip / nan); **not** sole primary over heldout/bpb |
| **Emission / subnet leaderboard** | Held-out / generalization primary → prequential bpb secondary → `final_score` / emission rank | Observability only; never emission substitution |
| **Miner dashboards** | Cosmetic | Always untrusted; cannot certify Official grade or unblock missing challenge series |

### 17.2 Schema identity and point fields

| step / batch index (`i`) or token_index | Yes (x-axis identity) | Align with instrument cadence |
| `train_ce_nats` / running prequential proxy | Yes | Same family as `_OnlineLossCapture` `online_loss` |
| `tokens_seen` (cumulative) | Yes | Token progress x-axis |
| `covered_bytes` (cumulative) | Yes when byte-basis bpb is shown | Matches scoring byte basis |
| `wall_s` / step wall deltas | Yes | Safety / thrash diagnostic only — **wall never ranks** |
| `grad_norm` | **Mandatory** under full telemetry pin | Challenge instrumentation around miner optim steps — **not** miner self-report |
| `clip_event` / clip counts | **Mandatory** under full telemetry pin | Clip firings / fraction when clip configured |
| `param_norm`, `lr` | Optional | Null + reason when not machine-visible |
| `nan_inf` | Yes when instrument can observe | Aligns with pred-loss NaN/Inf gate |

Manifest pointer sketch (when series is side-car):

```json
"metrics": {
  "online_loss": ["...legacy retained..."],
  "train_series_schema": "prism_train_series.v1",
  "train_series_path": "prism_train_series.v1.jsonl",
  "train_series_sha256": "..."
}
```

Series content is challenge-owned and participates in hashing / proof path when the Official pin requires it. Miner-written "train_series" JSON never unblocks a missing challenge stream.

### 17.3 Authority and anti-gaming

1. **Challenge capture only** — series produced inside Prism re-exec (instrument around `ctx.iter_train_batches` / graded train path), same ownership as online CE.
2. **Miner reports ignored** — dashboards, prints, free-form artifacts under `artifacts_dir`, and miner-authored series cannot certify Official grade, residuals, or emission eligibility.
3. **Gradients mandatory as challenge instrumentation** — `grad_norm` + `clip_events` come from challenge hooks / instrument, not miner logger aesthetics.
4. **No secret-val leak** — series must not stream secret held-out into the miner process.
5. **Wall-clock never primary** — wall series exist for thrash visibility only.

### 17.4 Fail-closed Official grade when series required

When the Official Comparison / Complete View grading pin sets **`require_train_series=true`** (or equivalent product flag):

| Condition | Official scientific grade outcome |
| --- | --- |
| Challenge series present, finite, provenance `authority=challenge` | Eligible for Official / Complete View grade (subject to other V gates) |
| Series **missing**, empty, corrupt, non-finite, miner-only provenance | **Fail-closed** Official grade — invalid / incomplete, **not** silent PASS |
| Miner dashboard present while challenge series missing | Still fail-closed — miner channel never authorizes |

Emission leaderboard may still score remaining bpb capture on a separate path with explicit incomplete-telemetry flags, but Official scientific rank must not pretend series was verified when the pin required it.

### 17.5 Residual role only (never sole primary rank)

Series may:

- densify **sample-efficiency** marks (online CE / running bpb vs tokens),
- real-fill **stability residual** (`grad_spike_rate`, clip thrash, nan_inf rate),
- drive **operator time-flow UI** (loss/bpb + grad_norm vs tokens/time).

Series must **not**:

- sole-rank packages over Official held-out primary or recomputed bpb secondary,
- replace multi-axis Complete View,
- become emission weight primary,
- unlock **REAL-PROVIDER TEE PASS** (telemetry and lab trains remain orthogonal; REAL TEE **BLOCKED** until provider contracts exist).

### 17.6 Operator / API sketch

| Surface | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Existing `GET .../submissions/{id}/curve` | Legacy online_loss vs covered_bytes |
| Extended train-series read (product path) | Multi-channel `prism_train_series.v1` including `grad_norm` / clip when present under existing auth |
| Operators UI / chart | Time-flow of loss/bpb + grad_norm; badge **challenge-owned** |
| Miner extra logs | Optional dashed "self-report"; never grade |

Capture and wire implementations land in subsequent telemetry-rt product features; this section locks **schema identity, authority, scientific-vs-emission grade split, residual rank role, and fail-closed policy**.

### 17.7 Non-claims

1. Train series are **not** REAL-PROVIDER TEE evidence.
2. Train series are **not** emission leaderboard primary (emission stays held-out primary + bpb secondary).
3. Inspectable lamp charts do **not** override held-out / polar Official rules.
4. Miner aesthetic grad/loss dashboards never certify scientific miner grade.
