"""Submission admission rule: require >=1 active worker for the submitting hotkey.

architecture.md 3.5: when ``worker_plane.admission_requires_worker`` is on, a prism submission
(direct ``POST /v1/submissions`` AND the base bridge path ``POST /internal/v1/bridge/submissions``,
identical enforcement) is rejected with HTTP 403 code ``NO_ACTIVE_WORKER`` unless the base master's
``GET /v1/workers/active?hotkey=`` confirms at least one active worker bound to that hotkey.

Fail-closed and bounded (VAL-PRISM-020): a master that is unreachable, times out, or returns a
non-2xx (5xx/4xx) can never confirm a worker, so the submission is rejected with the SAME 403
``NO_ACTIVE_WORKER`` shape used for an explicit zero-worker answer -- one deterministic response,
capped by ``worker_plane.admission_timeout_seconds``. With the flag off the check is a no-op and no
master call is made, so submission behavior is byte-identical to legacy (VAL-PRISM-015).
