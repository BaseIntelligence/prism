"""Base->prism result ingestion: verify the ExecutionProof, then finalize idempotently.

This is the prism half of the base worker-plane accept path (architecture.md 3.3/3.5). After the
base master reconciles a gpu work unit's R=2 replicas it forwards the accepted result here (the
``HttpChallengeResultForwarder`` counterpart) with the pinned body ``{work_unit_id, submission_ref,
result}``. Before anything is scored, the forwarded :class:`~prism_challenge.proof.ExecutionProof`
is verified:

* **shape** (VAL-PRISM-018): the envelope must exist, be ``version == 1``, carry a 64-char
  lowercase-hex ``manifest_sha256`` and a ``worker_signature`` with both ``worker_pubkey`` and
  ``sig``; each failure carries a distinguishable reason and NOTHING is scored;
* **integrity** (VAL-PRISM-007): the sr25519 signature must verify against the pinned message for
  this unit, and -- when the run manifest is forwarded -- its content must hash back to the signed
  ``manifest_sha256`` (a tampered manifest or a forged digest is rejected);
* **tier** (VAL-PRISM-019): the claimed tier is downgraded to its verified EFFECTIVE tier and the
  downgrade recorded, so the audit scheduler samples at the honest rate.

Only a fully verified result is finalized, and finalization is idempotent: the first accepted
delivery finalizes the submission from the FORWARDED, verified+reconciled manifest via the
CAS-guarded :meth:`PrismWorker.finalize_worker_result` path (worker plane on) -- scoring the run
WITHOUT re-executing the evaluator, since the heavy GPU work already ran on the miner-funded worker
(architecture.md 4). A duplicate delivery of the same manifest is a no-op and a CONFLICTING delivery
(a different ``manifest_sha256`` for an already-accepted unit) is rejected -- never overwriting the
stored score (VAL-PRISM-017). With the worker plane OFF, finalization falls back to the legacy
in-process re-execution path (:meth:`PrismWorker.process_submission`), byte-for-byte unchanged.
